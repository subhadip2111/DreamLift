The application lists exams, colleges, and career opportunities, providing students with the information they need to make informed decisions about their education and career.

## Objective

The main objective of WhatNext is to assist students in navigating their educational and career choices by:

- Highlighting potential career paths based on user input.
- Showcasing opportunities and colleges for various fields such as Engineering, Medical, Teaching, etc.
- Emphasizing the importance of skills, patience, and continuous improvement over single exam results.
- Making students aware of alternative ways to achieve their goals, such as joining top colleges like IITs and NITs even if they fail initially.
- Developing a resilient mindset in students, making them aware of multiple opportunities and upskilling them to think and live like graduates of top-tier institutions (e.g., IITians).
- Encouraging part-time teaching for financial stability while pursuing long-term goals.
